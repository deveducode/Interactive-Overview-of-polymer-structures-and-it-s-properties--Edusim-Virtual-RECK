### Theory of Interactive Overview of Polymer Structures and Its Properties

The interactive overview of polymer structures and their properties is based on the constructivist learning theory, which emphasizes active engagement and learner-centered exploration. This approach integrates visualizations, simulations, and hands-on digital tools to help learners grasp complex molecular arrangements of polymers—such as **linear**, **branched**, and **crosslinked** structures—and correlate them with key material properties like **strength**, **elasticity**, **thermal stability**, and **density**.

Through interactivity, students can manipulate molecular models, observe real-time property changes, and experiment with polymer modifications, fostering deeper conceptual understanding. This method bridges theoretical content with experiential learning, enhancing retention, problem-solving, and application of polymer science in real-world contexts.

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Linear**            | Chains are unbranched and aligned  | Flexible, low melting point, easy to process                  | Polyethylene (PE), PVC          |
| **Branched**          | Chains with side branches          | Lower density, less crystallinity, reduced strength           | Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) |
| **Crosslinked**       | Chains connected by covalent bonds | Rigid, high strength, heat-resistant, non-meltable            | Bakelite, Vulcanized rubber     |
| **Network**           | 3D interconnected structure        | Hard, brittle, thermosetting, excellent dimensional stability | Epoxy, Melamine-formaldehyde    |
| **Copolymer**         | Two or more different monomers     | Tunable properties (impact resistance, flexibility, etc.)     | ABS plastic, Nitrile rubber     |
